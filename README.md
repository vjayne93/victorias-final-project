**Philadelphia Free Food Site Analysis and Web Application**
------------------------------------------------------------

My project analyzes a list of 286 free food sites within the City of Philadelphia and the surronding counties obtained from the City's [Food and Meal Finder](https://www.phila.gov/food/) site and Share Food Program's [Find Food Tool](https://www.sharefoodprogram.org/find-food).

**Part I** of my project uses K-Means Cluster Analysis to create recommendations for areas of the city where new free food sites should be opened.

**Part II** of my project is the development of a web application called [Philly Food Finder](https://philly-food-finder-5ea79faeb9e3.herokuapp.com/) which tells the user where their nearest open free food site is, based on their address. The application works for addresses within twelve miles of Philadelphia. This web application is live now.

## Part I: K-Means Cluster Analysis
The K-Means Cluster Analysis classifies each census tract in Philadelphia as least need, average need, and highest need for additional food sites. This classification is based upon the following features: the percentage of people with low access to healthy food, the percentage of people living under the poverty line in each census tract, the number of food sites within one mile of each census tract, and the total food site operating hours within one mile of each census tract.
The feature <i>percentage of people with low access to healthy food</i> was calculated by the USDA's [May 2019 report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=93140) on areas of low food access, also known as "food deserts."<br><br>
In my analysis, I used unsupervised learning to find patterns in uncategorized data. I chose to use the K-Means Cluster Analysis method for my analysis for a number of reasons. My data was unlabled and did not come with any previous categorizations. My only point of comparison was to compare one census tract within my dataset to another, rather than comparing my data to previous findings. I wanted to find like attributes within my data and cluster this uncategorized data into categories. I specifically used the K-Means method because my data did not overlap and included multiple features. <br><br>

I completed two K-Means Cluster Analyses. The first weighted all features with the same importance. My first analysis indicated many census tracts in wealthy neighborhoods as part of the highest need group, because these neighborhoods have few free food sites. <br><br>

This image from my initial analysis shows the highest need areas in red, average need in yellow, and lowest need in green. It is inconsistent with the general understanding of poverty and food access in Philadelphia.

This zoomed-in image above shows how my intial Cluster Analysis indicated that one of the wealthiest census tracts in the city had the highest need of additional free food sites. 
<br><br>
My second analysis weighed the percentage of people living under the poverty line as three-times more significant than all other features. This second analysis indicated primarily high-poverty census tracts as the areas of highest need. <br>

<br><br>
My analysis indicates that the census tracts indicated in red have the highest levels of poverty and people able to obtain healthy food, combined with the lowest number of free food sites and total free food site operating hours. These census tracts should be prioritized by the City and hunger relief organizations for additional free food resources.<br><br> 

<b>The process of my K-Means Cluster Analysis is described below: </b>
* Clean datasets downloaded from the City of Philadelphia and Share Food Program to standardize addresses and hours of operation for all sites. Record cleaned data in a new spreadsheet. Filter data to Philadelphia sites only. 
* Load cleaned data into a Jupyter Notebook data frame. Due to the size of the dataset, I did not use a database tool to store the data. 
* Use OpenCageGeoCode API to assign a latitude and longitude value to all food sites. Create new data frame with these coordinates.
* Create a function to parse the operating days and hours of each site.
* Load GEOJSON from USDA on food availability by census tract & CSV from US Census Bureau on poverty levels by census tract to notebook.
* Create BallTree to do spacial analysis of food sites and determine the number of food sites within a one-mile radius of each census tract.
* Complete K-Means Cluster Analysis of the features of each census tract. Sort data into three clusters indicating least need, normal need, and highest need.
* Complete second K-Means Cluster Analysis which weighs poverty as three-times more significant than the other features to create a more accurate assesment of need.

## Part II: Web Application
With the clean dataset of free food sites in the Philadelphia area I used in Part I of my project, I created a Python web application which finds the nearest open free food site to the user's address. Existing applications to find free food sites rely on complex websites with maps and multiple filtering options. These applications can be challenging for people in need of free food. Barriers include applications not being optimized for mobile use, low tech literacy among users, poor eyesite or limited dexterity using a device, limited English language skills, and applications using significant amounts of data. My intent was to make the most simple and functional applications to tell users where they can get free food, right now. <br><br>
My application uses a Python function to determine what free food sites are open at the current date and time based on my existing dataset. The user enters their address, and the application uses a geocoding API to locate the user and list the five current open food sites which are closest to the entered address. The user can request the next five closest sites which are open now. A second function finds the sites which are opening the soonest and reports them to the user.
