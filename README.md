**Philadelphia Free Food Site Analysis and Web Application**
------------------------------------------------------------

My project analyzes a list of free food sites within the City of Philadelphia obtained from the city's [Food and Meal Finder](https://www.phila.gov/food/) site.

**Part I** of my project uses K-Means Cluster Analysis to create recommendations for areas of the city where new free food sites should be opened.

**Part II** of my project is the development of a web application called [Philly Food Finder](https://philly-food-finder-5ea79faeb9e3.herokuapp.com/) which tells the user where their nearest open free food site is in Philadelphia, based on their address. This web application is live now.
